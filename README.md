# Lattice Polymers

The goal of the project is to create a reliable lattice model for protein dynamics.
The system under consideration is an artificial protein knot.
The model takes into account side chain interactions (charged, polar, hydrophobic),H-bonds, chain stiffness and steric clashes.

Model description:
- Lattice: FCC
- Hamiltonan: Side - chain interactions, H-bonds, dihedral angles (from stiffness), steric clashes
- Moves: pull, slingshot, side chain reorientation
